Multiwii_shared and MultiWiiConf_shared can be modified by every contributors
   -> is a shared area for every commiter


Some simple rules:
   - do not commit something that does not compile / check with various config settings
   - try to respect the tabulations for readability
   - avoid float numbers
   - try to isolate your code if possible via #define statements
   - no new tabs
   - no C++ class
   - only stdint variables (no int or no long, int16_t or int32_t instead)
   - short code and fast code :)
