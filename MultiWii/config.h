   Spektrum Satellites are 3V devices.  DO NOT connect to 5V!
   For MEGA boards, attach sat grey wire to RX1, pin 19. Sat black wire to ground. Sat orange wire to Mega board's 3.3V (or any other 3V to 3.3V source).
   For PROMINI, attach sat grey to RX0.  Attach sat black to ground.  
     There is no 3.3V source on a pro mini; you can either use a different 3V source, or attach orange to 5V with a 3V regulator in-line (such as http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=MCP1700-3002E/TO-ND)
     If you use an inline-regulator, a standard 3-pin servo connector can connect to ground, +5V, and RX0; solder the correct wires (and the 3V regulator!) to a Spektrum baseRX-to-Sat cable that has been cut in half. 
     NOTE: Because there is only one serial port on the Pro Mini, using a Spektrum Satellite implies you CANNOT use the PC based configuration tool. Further, you cannot use on-aircraft serial LCD as the baud rates are incompatible. You can configure by one of two methods:
       1) Coming soon: Use an on-aircraft Eagle Tree LCD for setting gains, reading sensors, etc. 
       2) Available now: Comment out the Spektrum definition, upload, plug in PC, configure; uncomment the Spektrum definition, upload, plug in RX, and fly.  Repeat as required to configure.
